It's hard to believe that the last time the four of us were in the same place was 
seventeen years ago. But here we are, all together again, in Portland, Maine while Mom 
recovers from a broken hip, and a subsequent replacement.

Mom's excellent physical shape (from long daily walks with Charlie) and her
fierce independent streak means the pace of her recovery is, well, nothing short of
amazing. I am incredibly proud and inspired. You rock, Mom!

Lots of love to Mom, Alden, and Nathan. And Charlie too!
