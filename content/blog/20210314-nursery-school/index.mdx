![Class picture](IMG_1376-2.jpg)

I have had this photograph for 50-ish years, always assuming it was an elementary school class picture. Recently, I pulled it out of a folder I hadn't opened in years and showed it to Susie. After scanning faces for a few seconds, she exclaimed, "That's me!". I never realized that the little blond haired girl is Susie! And I'm standing behind her! Neither of us has any recollection of the other from this time, and our paths probably did not cross again until high school. It's amazing though just how far back we go.
