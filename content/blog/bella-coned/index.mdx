Fights over food between our two coonhounds, which don't happen often, usually amount 
to barking and snapping, but this time Henry tore a nasty hole in Bella's leg, 
requiring a trip to the emergency vet where she received stitches, a drain, and a 
dog's least favorite accessory. 

Counter to my dictates, we are keeping Henry.
