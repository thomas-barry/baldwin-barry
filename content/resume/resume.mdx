## Summary
I have more than twenty-five years of experience in the design and development of web applications, content-management systems, banking software, 
and mission-critical relational databases; and have enjoyed success as a full-time employee, small business owner, and independent consultant.

During the last five years I managed teams responsible for designing and building UI frameworks used by Wells Fargo's online banking applications. 
I am also responsible for defining standards and best practices for UI development, as well as mentoring front-end developers.
