I am a successful software engineer with 25-plus years of experience and chronic imposter syndrome.

I ride bicycles. Sometimes on trails, sometimes on gravel, but mostly on pavement. Sometimes for long distances.

I am a rudimentary piano player.

I am an amateur photographer.

I am happily married to my high school sweetheart after being apart twenty-three years.

My wife and I have three coonhounds that we love dearly, despite the fact that they are coonhounds.

I believe in social justice.
